In the beginning you get a source and target DNA strand in the form of numbers that have a certain sequence.
The goal of the assignment is by applying the least amount of inversions necessary to the source DNA to get 
the target DNA. This can be done by the following components:

1. Looking for inverted areas
2. Inverting parts of a DNA sequence
3. Finding the fastest way to fix the inverted areas
