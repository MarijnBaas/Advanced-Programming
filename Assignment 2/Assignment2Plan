The plan is to make a list with sublists and store what type of cell is inside the cell so for example a 3 by 3 grid 
would be [[I, T, M],[I, T, M],[I, T, M]]. The cell types all have a common parent that defines what parameters all cell
types have so in this case it would be:
- mobility
- killing ability
- growth rate. 
What these are will be defined in the child which will be the specific cell type. After that the simulation will be 
run from the left to right and then top to bottom. If there is a cell within the specified cell it will then do an action depending on a random number p generated with the random function. Possible actions are and the formula used
to calculate the probability depend on the attributes above with mobility (m), killing (k) and growth rate (g):
- Move      (with probability p =< m/(m+k+g))
- Kill      (with probability if m/(m+k+g) < p =< (m+k)/(m+k+g))
- Spawn     (with probability p > (m+k)/(m+k+g))
- Rest      (happens if the seleceted action is not possible)

What is better to define the within the cell types all the locations where they are or within a list what cell types
are at which positions?

Do you have to every time make a new grid with the new positions in letters or is it possible to keep it within the 
cell types?

Should we omit all options that have a 0 already in the beginning?

Cells that are spawned should be added to the queue in the same iteration!!

If it moves it should not be calculated again!!

If it kills it does not move to the square which it kills!!
